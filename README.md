# Credit Scoring Model
### Predicting Creditworthiness using Machine Learning  

---

##  Overview  
This project predicts whether a person is **creditworthy** or **not** using financial and demographic data.  
I implemented three models — **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree**, and **Random Forest** — and compared their performance to identify the best predictor.  

This project is part of my **Machine Learning Internship at https://www.codealpha.tech/index.html

##  Dataset  
The dataset includes:  
- Income  
- Loan Amount  
- Loan Grade  
- Interest Rate  
- Credit History Length  
- Loan Status *(Target)*  

Goal → Predict whether a borrower will **repay** or **default** on their loan.

##  Workflow  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Missing value handling  
   - Label encoding of categorical variables  
   - Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`  

2. **Model Training**  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Decision Tree Classifier  
   - Random Forest Classifier  

3. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Accuracy  
   - Precision  
   - Recall  
   - F1-Score

##  Results  
The **Random Forest** model achieved the highest accuracy and overall performance.
